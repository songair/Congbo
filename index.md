I'm a <span style="color:blue">**[Senior Research Scientist](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/congbo-song)**</span> (2022.12-) in Data Science and Analytics in Atmospheric Air Pollution, at The **[National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)](https://ncas.ac.uk)** based in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science, the University of Manchester. My research interests are in the field of **Chain of Air Pollution Accountability**, including Emissions, Air Quality, Public health and Air Quality Interventions. A key aspect of my research is to understand the impacts of source-specific air pollution on human health and climate through advanced receptor modeling. I'm also interested in understanding environmental policies, environmental drivers and atmospheric processes controlling the air we breath using data-driven models such as machine learning and casual inference techniques.

I'm a member of the **[Manchester Environmental Data Analytics Lab (MEDAL)](https://m-edal.github.io)**, with [Prof. David Topping](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/david.topping) and [Dr. Zhonghua Zheng](https://zhonghuazheng.com).
