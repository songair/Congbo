**Congbo Song** currently is a <span style="color:blue">**[research fellow](https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/persons/congbo-song)**</span> (2019.08-) in Atmospheric Science, School of Geography, Earth and Environment Sciences, University of Birmingham. He is working with Prof. **[Zongbo Shi](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/shi-zongbo.aspx)** and **[Roy Harrison](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/harrison-roy.aspx)**. Congbo is working on a project of SEANA â€“ Shipping Emissions in the Arctic and North Atlantic Atmosphere (**[SEANA](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/environmental-health/projects/seana/index.aspx))**, with particular interest in anthropogenic and natural sources of air pollutants. His research interestes include:

- Source Emissions and their impacts on atmospheric environment. 

- Source Apportionment and environmental drivers for source-specific air pollutants.

- Casual inference and its application in atmopheric science. 

- Air pollution exposure and health risk assessment.

Congbo has published over 30 peer-reviewed articles (**[list](/pages/publications)**), his h-index is 16, and has over 1595 times citations (**[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JcL-uzcAAAAJ&hl=en)**).

Congbo studied at the College of Civil and Environmental Engineering in University of Science & Technology in Beijing between 2008 and 2012 (Bachelor's degree), and the College of Environmental Science and Engineering in Nankai University between 2012 and 2019 (Master's and PhD degrees). During his PhD study, he was supervised by Prof. **[Hongjun Mao](https://env.nankai.edu.cn/2019/0612/c14180a177249/page.htm)** to study on-road fleet average emissions and their impacts on multi-scale atmosphere environment.
